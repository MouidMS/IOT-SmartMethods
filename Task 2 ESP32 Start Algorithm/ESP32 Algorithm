In this task, I program the ESP32 with Arduino IDE.

1-install SP32 Board in Arduino IDE.
2-decide the pins and set it in the code.
3-Upload Code to the ESP32.
4-controlling an LED connected
5-check if the LED connected is blinking.

//the code 

// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
}
